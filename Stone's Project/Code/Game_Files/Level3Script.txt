You have Defeated my Useless Subordinates
But you Shall Die Here!
Behold, the True Power of Darkness!
No! This is not over!
The Great Evil! Take my Soul and Flesh! Haunt this World Again!
It seems like you have won the game. 
You hear a voice in your head.
"If you spare everyone, the story ends differently"
